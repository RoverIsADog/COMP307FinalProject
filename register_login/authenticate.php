I don't care what happens in here, but after this block $loggedIn should
be set to the proper value! (T/F)

INPUTS:
	$isAuth; // Value is currently placeholder true.
	$currentSection; // {"profile", "rate", "admin", "management, "sysop"}
	$currentPage; // See gooogle doc for accepted strings
	

EFFECTS/OUTPUTS:
	This function should set $loggerIn to the correct value. No output.
